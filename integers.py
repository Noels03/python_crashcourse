#The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

#Beautiful is better than ugly.
#Explicit is better than implicit.
#Simple is better than complex.
#Complex is better than complicated.
#Flat is better than nested.
#Sparse is better than dense.
#Readability counts.
#Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
#Although practicality beats purity.
#Errors should never pass silently.
#Unless explicitly silenced.
#In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
#There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
#Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
#Now is better than never.
#Although never is often better than *right* now.
#If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
#If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
#Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
